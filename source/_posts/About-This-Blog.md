### Welcome on my personal blog.
The reason for which I started to write this blog was just to systemize my knowledge.
You will find here materials on such subjects as: Systems Architecture, Different Programming Paradigms, Low Level Programming, Networking, Storage, Security, Virtualization, Operating Systems as well lots of other topics that are in my head.

### About Blog Engine
This blog uses the Hexo engine and Freemind theme. For quite some time I wanted to start blogging, but I really wanted to use something funnier than WordPress. Recently I had to write something in NodeJS and having done that, I found that javascript can be quite interesting (yes really!). So as not to finish with NodeJS, I decided to start something that can be called a project within a project. As I wanted to blog and also do something useful with NodeJS, the idea was to use a blog engine written in NodeJS and try to play with it.

If you are interested in Hexo or Freemind, you can find more details at theys github-s:

### About me
I always wanted to describe myself as an engineer. Well, maybe not always but definitely since college.
When you try to define what 'engineer' actually means, you will probably evoke this definition from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote Wikipedia, source: Oxford Concise Dictionary %}
An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word engineer is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness").
{% endblockquote %}

In my opinion the best part of this definition is about using knowledge to develop solutions to particular technical problems.

I started my engineer career as an embedded software responsible for developing medical devices. Then I was developing complex computations for parallel machines, next was developing software for broadcasting and multimedia platforms, writing webservices and calculations for financial industry, or creating software for cloud platform.
All of that equipped me with some practical knowledge of what different softwares and infrastructures may look like. Yet on the other hand, my work never quite gave me an opportunity to go deeper into details and principles of technologies, so I always had to study myself at home.

Some of my personal (aka. proffesional) interests: Systems and Application Performance, Calculations and Parallel Computing, Operating Systems, Low Level Programming, Networking, Storage, Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence (Mainly Neural Networks) and everything else that force my brain to think and attracts my attention :)

At the end of this first introductory post, I want to evoke two statements from really good post that I came across a few years ago:

{% blockquote John Sonmez http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/19/software-development-career/ 4 Things I Wish I Would Have Known When I Started My Software Development Career %}
Always have a side project
Put everything I learned together
{% endblockquote %}

So I simply treat my blog as a side project, where I am trying to put and order things together.

If you are interested in collaboration or simply you would like to know the guy who is writing all of these *nonsenses* you can find my resume [here](http://res.cloudinary.com/gotocco/image/upload/v1529558247/cv_mgrochow_qo94r3.pdf).
