### Welcome on my personal blog.
The reason for which I started to write this blog was just to systemize my knowledge.
You will find here materials on such subjects as: Systems Architecture, Different Programming Paradigms, Low Level Programming, Networking, Storage, Security, Virtualization, Operating Systems as well lots of other topics that are in my head.

### About me

#### Intro
I always wanted to describe myself as an engineer. Well, maybe not always but definitely since the college.
When you try to define what 'engineer' actually means, you will probably evoke this definition from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote Wikipedia, __source: Oxford Concise Dictionary %}
An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word engineer is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness").
{% endblockquote %}

In my opinion the best part of this definition is about using knowledge to develop solutions to particular technical problems.

#### Bio
I started my engineer career as an embedded software responsible for developing medical devices.
Real-Time OS, small microcontrollers with a lot of peripherals, sometimes embedded Linux.
I got also some opportunity from my University to develop some scientific code on NVIDIA CUDA.
But as unfortunately, as often happens with scientific projects they can silently die.
So I stuck with embedded systems for a while, until my curiosity pushed me to application development.
Application development is one of these topics that some people love it and others hate it.
To be frank I have learned a lot during the application development especially things related to design patterns or different programming paradigms. But after some time I realized that I don't want to do only apps for the rest of my life, and I started exploring other areas as a security, system programming.
After some time I got an opportunity to start doing more system development so I quit my app job and merrily switched. I believe that was a point in my life that I realized that I am in the proper place.
I got some brilliant opportunities to work on Networking Stack, Crypto Libraries, System Performance or File Systems, for which I am very thankful to my former employers.

#### Interests
The languages I'm familiar with: C, C++, Assembly (from AVR to x86), Python, Ruby, Java, Clojure, GO.. (I am still trying to learn some new ones)
Topics I'm mainly interested in: Operating Systems, Calculations and Parallel Computing, Low Level Software, Security/Vulnerabilities, Networking (not only Internet), Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence (Mainly Neural Networks) and everything else that gets my brain to think and attracts my attention :)

#### Goal of this blog
At the end of this first introductory post, I want to evoke two statements from really good post that I came across a few years ago:

{% blockquote John Sonmez http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/19/software-development-career/ 	__4 Things I Wish I Would Have Known When I Started My Software Development Career %}
Always have a side project
Putting everything learned together
{% endblockquote %}

So I simply treat my blog as a side project, where I am trying to put and order things that I learned together.

If you are interested in collaboration or simply you would like to know the guy who is writing all of these *nonsenses* you can find my resume [here](http://res.cloudinary.com/gotocco/image/upload/v1529558247/cv_mgrochow_qo94r3.pdf).
### About Blog Engine
This blog uses the Hexo engine and Freemind theme. For quite some time I wanted to start blogging, but I really wanted to use something funnier than WordPress. Recently I had to write something in NodeJS and having done that, I found that javascript can be quite interesting (yes really!). So as not to finish with NodeJS, I decided to start something that can be called a project within a project. As I wanted to blog and also do something useful with NodeJS, the idea was to use a blog engine written in NodeJS and try to play with it.

If you are interested in Hexo or Freemind, you can find more details at theys github-s:
