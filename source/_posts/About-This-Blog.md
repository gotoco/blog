### Welcome on my personal blog.
The reason for which I started to write this blog was just to systemize my knowledge.
You will find here materials on such subjects as: Systems Architecture, Different Programming Paradigms, Low Level Programming, Networking, Storage, Security, Virtualization, Operating Systems as well lots of other topics that are in my head.

### About Blog Engine
This blog uses the Hexo engine and tranquilpeak theme. For quite some time I wanted to start blogging, but I really wanted to use something funnier than WordPress. Recently I had to write something in NodeJS and having done that, I found that javascript can be quite interesting (yes really!). So as not to finish with NodeJS, I decided to start something that can be called a project within a project. As I wanted to blog and also do something useful with NodeJS, the idea was to use a blog engine written in NodeJS and try to play with it. (The original idea was to write my own engine but due to lack of time I decided against starting everything from scratch. Maybe one day... :)

If you are interested in Hexo or Tranquilpeak, you can find more details at theys github-s:

### About me
I always wanted to describe myself as an engineer. Well, maybe not always but definitely since college.
When you try to define what 'engineer' actually means, you will probably evoke this definition from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote Wikipedia, source: Oxford Concise Dictionary %}
An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word engineer is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness").
{% endblockquote %}

In my opinion the best part of this definition is about using knowledge to develop solutions to particular technical problems.

During my career I worked on different projects for various industries (medical devices, entertainment, industry and finances, among others).
I started my engineer career as an embedded software responsible for developing medical devices. Then I was developing complex computations for parallel machines, next was developing software for broadcasting and multimedia platforms, writing webservices and calculations for financial industry, or creating software for cloud platform.
All of that equipped me with some practical knowledge of what different softwares and infrastructures may look like. Yet on the other hand, my work never quite gave me an opportunity to go deeper into details and principles of technologies, so I always had to study myself at home.

The languages I'm familiar with: C, C++, Assembly(from AVR to x86), Python, Ruby, Java, Clojure, GO, Erlang.. (I am still trying to learn some new ones)
Topics I'm interested in: Operating Systems, Calculations and Parallel Computing, Low Level Software, Security/Vulnerabilities, Networking (not only Internet), Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence and everything else that gets my brain to think and attracts my attention :)

At the end of this first introductory post, I want to evoke two statements from really good post that I came across a few years ago:

{% blockquote John Sonmez http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/19/software-development-career/ 4 Things I Wish I Would Have Known When I Started My Software Development Career %}
Always have a side project
Putting everything I learned together
{% endblockquote %}

So I simply treat my blog as a side project, where I am trying to put and order things together.
